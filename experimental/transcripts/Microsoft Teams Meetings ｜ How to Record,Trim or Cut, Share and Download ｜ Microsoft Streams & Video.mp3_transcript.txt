Speaker A: Hi dear friends.
Speaker B: Today in this video we're going to.
Speaker A: Focus on a very important feature of Microsoft Teams. It is all about recording the meetings. So when it comes to recording a meeting, each meeting has its own privacy concept in it. Like we invite people who supposed to attend the meeting, right? So when you are actually recording the meeting, you're actually creating a kind of a record for what happened in the meeting. So it is very important to deal with such recordings. So these kind of meeting recordings are saved in Microsoft Stream by default. You know usually who is recording, they become the owner of the video that gets saved in the stream and the people who are part of the meetings will have access to the recorded video.
Speaker B: By default because it will be part.
Speaker A: Of the meetings chart. But what if you want to share with someone who's not part of the meeting? In that case you need to delegate the permissions from the Microsoft Stream application. The point that I want to make here is like each meeting has its own privacy consideration. So if you do not do the sharing of recorded video of a meeting, then it can impact the privacy of the meeting itself. So it is very important to keep extra careful steps when you are actually sharing a meetings video to somebody who was not part of the meeting. So without further ado, let us get into the teams interface and see how can you effectively and safely share a recorded video. And before sharing a recorded video, you also have a default capability available within the Microsoft stream to trim the video so that you can cut short the video size and the time of the video and ensure that you only share the video part which are important for the audience to which you are planning to share the video. So let's take a look at the Microsoft Teams interface and the stream interface on the go and understand how can you effectively do, record, trim and share in your meetings video.
Speaker B: Let us create a meeting and invite the record participants to it in order to record the meeting and then do the rest of the activities like sharing, trimming and all. So I'm just adding a few admins of my organizations and setting up a session to explain something related to administration, whatever. So in case, if you have any channel that you want to add to it, and you can do that as well and let us start the meeting and wait for the rest of the invitees to join while they are joining, let me just tell you that you know the moment that you start the recording, it will be displayed as a banner to the all participants of the meeting and they will get to know that you are recording the video. If you are not aware just as a heads up to you. So people are now joining in. We will just start the recording as soon as everybody is joined. So I hope we have all the people available now. Four of them who accepted the meetings are all joined. Let's start start the recording. So as I mentioned a minute ago a few seconds ago that this banner will be displayed to all the participants of the meeting. And once you decide that the meeting is ended or it is going to be ended, then you can stop the recording or otherwise the recording will automatically end when you stop the meeting itself. So as I mentioned during the introduction part of the video, who is recording the video of the meeting will become the owner of the video as well. I just stopped the recording. That should be good enough for us to do the rest of the activities like trimming and sharing. So now once you stop the video, this will create a video and will start uploading to the Microsoft stream. As I mentioned during the introduction of the video, if you go back to the chat, you can see that status right there. Let us wait to complete the processing of the video. Now the video processing processing is completed and then uploaded to the stream. If you click on the three dots there, there is something called a Share button there and a Get link. So get link is the link directly to open the video on a browser. So if you choose to share from here, this is what I was mentioning that you have to be extra careful. This will share the video to the whole organization. So do not ever try to share the recorded video right from the teams interface. Instead, go to the Manage permission on stream option and in case if it asks you to enter the username and password, please do so. In usual cases it will be a single sign on. It will take you directly to the streams page and navigate to the videos section. And this is the place where you actually do the trimming and sharing of a recorded video. All the videos that you recorded will be available there. Choose the one which you really want to share with somebody who's not part of the meeting. Before sharing, you can trim it in simple steps. You can just drag and drop it like you usually do the video cutting software. And then there is an Apply button on the top. Just apply it. It will start processing the shorter version of the video that we created. It might take a while. While the trimming is happening, let's try to open the link. I'm trying to play the video as someone else and the person who's trying to play the video is Jovin who was not part of the meetings and you can rightly see there that it is clearly mentioning that person do not have the access to play the video. So now the trimming is yet to be finished, so let us try to refresh it and see if the status. Yes, the trimming is completed and if you play it you can see that it is a shorter video. It was 1 minute and 3 seconds earlier, now it is only 53 seconds. Now we can share. You know you have add to group or channel option and wherein you have an option to search for people, type the username Jovin and then once you click add it he will have the read access. You have an option to make it as honor, but in this case I'm only making him as a reader of the video. So one, if you refresh the page again it will start playing the video. So the process is very simple, but it is very important that you do the process rightly and from the recommended way so that it will only get shared with the people who really want to share the video with.
Speaker A: So now we have seen how easy is to manage the Microsoft Teams meetings recordings and its permissions. I will not say that sharing, rather I will consider it as the permissions to view the recordings of Microsoft Teams. So it is very important that you do it right in order to save the privacy of the recordings that we make. Because the reason why I'll tell you like you know, you are, you're actually recording a video with the permission of all the participants in the meeting and.
Speaker B: It may not be right to share.
Speaker A: Ineffectively the recordings because the participants are.
Speaker B: Not knowing to whom you are sharing.
Speaker A: The meeting recordings unless you mention to the meeting saying like that this, these meetings will be shared across the organization or it will be shared publicly and so forth. So each meeting, as I mentioned during the first section of the video that it has got its own privacy consideration. So it is very important when modifying the permission of the meetings recording so.
Speaker B: That it will be only visible to.
Speaker A: The people or to the audience, those who really need to see the meeting recordings. I recommend to use the Microsoft stream to share any teams meeting recordings. The reason why I'm saying this stream because all the meeting recordings are getting saved into Microsoft Team streams.
Speaker B: There are options to download the meeting.
Speaker A: Recordings from the stream itself and you can share it in some other way of sharing it. In case if you want to share with somebody outside the organization, you can do that. But in all cases make use of the streams interface to do all the kind of modification that you want to make it in terms of the video content or the permissions and so forth. I hope the video was informational in terms of the Microsoft Teams meeting recordings. If then please do not forget to subscribe the channel and ensure that you get the notifications also when you subscribe.
Speaker B: The channel so that you will get.
Speaker A: To know the new video that I'm going to come up with. Thank you for watching and have a nice day. See you.
